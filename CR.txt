What are the main components?
The main components are the main,TempManager and api scripts.
They coordinate data from the api to our database, server and eventually the client.

What are their responsibilities? What do they do?

We get all of our data from our weather api and make all our requests, from the api script.
The database holds all the data of our users favorite cities, and our TempManager.js helps
us deliver the requested data from our server to our client by storing it in the city 
data array. 
Eventually all our data comes to our main.js, the main.js helps collect and deliver all our data
to our Renderer.js wich renders and displays all our data to the user.

How do they talk to each other?
Our server and our database comunicate through our mongoose package which allows us to make contact to our mongoDB.
Our TempManager Class and our client helps us collect our data from the server and render it to the user. 

Special usage of a function, library, technology
For the first time ever I used the moment npm package to make my dates look presentable.
I also learned about how to handle asynchronous with the try and catch statements.

Cover code parts that were challenging/interesting for you => explain the problem and how you solved it
I found the coding process pretty straight forward but encountered alot of bugs that consumed alot of time 
on debugging.
